# Handling changes
If you need to change things such as navbar for example, you will find all the reusable component througout the pages in the folder : `/src/partials`.
Change the html here and modifiy the css in the good file in `/src/scss`.
That is almost everything you need to know.

If you have run : `npm run start`, parcels has an excellent hot reload except if you are on another page than index.html. There is a bug with parcels that requires you to manually refresh the page when you are not working on `index.html`.
